# Pathfinder-Visualization
A fun tool that uses pathfinding algorithms in a visual setting.
This program allows you to choose the start and end at any location in order to view the process of the algorithm finding the shortest path from start to end of the locations chosen. 
The algorithms that supports this program are Dijkstra's Algorithm, Breadth-First Search, and Depth-First Search that determines the shortest path possible. 

# Requirements

Download Pygame by going to the command prompt.
Type: "pip install pygame" to download Pygame.
On the command prompt, type "python".
Type "import pygame" (You should get a message that says "Hello from the pygame community.").
Ready to code and run the Pygame in the downloaded IDLE (Python 3.9.2).
